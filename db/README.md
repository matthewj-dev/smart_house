# db Folder
* Here is where we keep all database scripts.
* Generally, we'll probably have 2 scripts (which could call other scripts)
    + One script will start over from scratch
    + The other will just update functions and other non-structure object, so it should be safe to run whenever.
* Everything (so far) is in the smart_house schema to separate object from this project from other projects. (Until we can get a different database)
